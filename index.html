               <li> <b> 1963: </b>Mercury and his family fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the Zanzibar Revolution.

               <li> <b> 1971: </b>Freddie and the others were joined by bassist John Deacon. Despite reservations of the other members
                  Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band
               </li>
               <li> <b> 1973: </b>Queen signed to a deal with Trident/EMI, and they released their eponymous debut album</li>
               <li> <b> 1975 </b>Queen recorded and released A Night at the Opera. At the time, it was the most expensive album ever produce.
                  The album also featured the hit single "Bohemian Rhapsody", which was number one in the UK for nine weeks
               </li>
               <li> <b> 1976: </b>Freddie told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship</li>
